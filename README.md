## General info
I plan on creating an algorithm that can generate personalized cheese platters based on user preferences. This will be possible by asking the user a series of questions and choices about their taste preferences, the texture, aroma, geographical origin, price, season, and date of the cheese. In the end, the algorithm will output a cheese platter based on the answers of the user. He will then be able to purchase that platter at the nearest cheese dairy. ***And if he does not completely trust the algorithm to make the purchase, he can ask to have small samples of the different cheeses that appear on the platter.*** In this part of the project, we start by collecting the necessary data that we will later use for our algorithm. We collect the data from the two following sites:
<ul>
  <li>[Website 1:](https://www.quiveutdufromage.com/liste-des-fromages)</li>
  <li>[Website 2:](https://www.fromages.com/fr/encyclopedie)</li>
</ul>
