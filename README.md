France is known for its **wide variety of high-quality cheeses** and French cheese is famous all over the world. It is an **essential part of French cuisine**, and it is often served on a platter after a meal.  According to the International Dairy Federation, the average per capita consumption of cheese is around **26.4 kg/year**. According to the French Dairy Interbranch Organization (CNIEL), the average French household spends about **435 euros per year** on cheese. This works to be around **8.4 euros per week**. French take their cheese **very seriously and it is an important part of their cultural heritage and culinary tradition**. 

There are more than **400 different types of cheese** produced in France, each with its own unique flavor, texture, and appearance. Since they are willing to pay a premium for high-quality cheese, it should match their taste preferences. Even if French people have a deep knowledge of cheese and can distinguish between different varieties there are just too many and sometimes it's overwhelming to choose. 

“Therefore I plan on creating an algorithm that can generate personalized cheese platters based on user preferences. This will be possible by asking the user a series of questions and choices about their taste preferences, the texture, aroma, geographical origin, price, season, and date of the cheese. In the end, the algorithm will output a cheese platter based on the answers of the user. He will then be able to purchase that platter at the nearest cheese dairy. ***And if he does not completely trust the algorithm to make the purchase, he can ask to have small samples of the different cheeses that appear on the platter.*** 

Newbies will also be able to participate and discover the vast world of cheese. After completing the questionnaire, in addition to purchasing the platter, they will also receive a bunch of cards with a detailed explanation of the selection of cheeses they have. This will include: 

1. The name of the cheese
2. A brief description of the cheese, including notable characteristics/features, nutrition information such as calorie count, fat content, and protein content
3. Country or region of origin (France → region)
4. Type of milk used (cow, goat, sheep, etc)
5. Texture (soft, hard, crumbly, etc)
6. Flavor profile (mild, strong, salty, sweet, nutty, fruity, etc)
7. Age (fresh, young, mature, aged)  & when best to eat it
8. Serving suggestions: What to pair it with (food and beverages)
9. Popular uses in cooking/cuisine (if possible)
10. Examples of similar cheeses for comparison/context

If, after the algorithms answer, they are reluctant to try the cheeses that appeared, they have the possibility to go with familiar types. These cheeses are widely available and have relatively mild flavors that are appealing to many people. 

People who are a little bit more daring can decide to randomize their cheese platter(select cheese that they already have tasted & algorithm will remove them) and receive a completely new set of cheeses. 

**GOAL**: It’s a **tool** for people who are new to cheese and want to learn more about ≠ types of cheese and flavor profiles, as well as more experienced cheese lovers who are looking for new combinations & recommendations. This can also be beneficial for people who are vegetarian or lactose intolerant or have certain requirements when eating food.”
