## General info
â€œI plan on creating an algorithm that can generate personalized cheese platters based on user preferences. This will be possible by asking the user a series of questions and choices about their taste preferences, the texture, aroma, geographical origin, price, season, and date of the cheese. In the end, the algorithm will output a cheese platter based on the answers of the user. He will then be able to purchase that platter at the nearest cheese dairy. ***And if he does not completely trust the algorithm to make the purchase, he can ask to have small samples of the different cheeses that appear on the platter.***  In this part of the project, we will go to the following (website)[https://www.fromages.com/fr/] and try to scrape the necessary information that will be needed for the algorithm.
